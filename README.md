# Factores-relacionados-a-ansiedad-rasgo-en-estudiantes-de-Estad-stica-en-la-Universidad-de-Costa-Ric
In this project I was interested in determining what are the factors that are related to trait anxiety in statistics students of Universidad de Costa Rica in 2021. This with the purpose of knowing protective factors against trait anxiety, as well as knowing the relationship that exists between the selected predictors and the response variable (trait anxiety). To achieve this goal, a multiple linear regression analysis was performed, and data were collected using a questionnaire applied to students.
